# React Memo Component

React memorization with render children pattern.

## Deprecation

Please refer to the successor [@yao-react/react-memo](https://github.com/yao-react/react-memo)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-memo-component
```

## Usage

```tsx
import Memo from "react-memo-component";
// import { Memo } from "react-memo-component"; // or

<Memo
  deps={[dep1, dep2, ...]}
  render={([dep1, dep2, ...]) => <div>...</div>}
/>
```

## Props

- deps?: any
  > Any deps of the component, common format is an array of items.
- compare?: (prevDeps, nextDeps) => boolean
  > Function used to compare the deps. If snapshots of deps are different, rerender will be triggered.
  > By default, shallow-equal algorithm will be used if `compare` is not specified.
- render?: (deps) => ReactElement
- children?: (deps) => ReactElement

## Advanced Usage

### Use hooks inside render

You can use hooks inside the render function, which allows you to further optimize your render structure.

If your lint complains about it, you can write your render function as `function Comp() {...}`, which fools the lint to 
see it as a component, but you should know it is not, as it is only a normal function called inside the Memo component.
